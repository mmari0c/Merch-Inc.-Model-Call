# Merch Inc. Model Call

A web platform to streamline the **model call process** for Merch Inc.’s semester fashion shows.  
This project replaces the current messy, manual process (shared laptops, forgotten numbers, confusing picks) with a **simple, transparent, and organized system**.

---

## Overview
Every semester, Merch Inc. hosts a fashion show where designers select models.  
Currently, the process is slowed down by:
- Manual sign-ups on a few laptops
- Models forgetting their assigned numbers
- Designers struggling to track who is available vs. already picked

**This project solves those problems by providing:**
- A sign-up portal for models and designers
- Profiles with photos and details
- A transparent selection system with real-time updates
- An admin dashboard to manage stages and export results
